# Post-Quantum Cryptography Project

This project is developed as part of the SIRS course, aiming to deepen understanding of key exchange protocols and explore post-quantum cryptography solutions.

The main focus is to study and adapt the **Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE)** protocol to a post-quantum context, ensuring **authenticity** of communications and **security** against adversaries equipped with quantum computers.

## Project Objectives

- Understand classical key exchange protocols and their authentication mechanisms.  
- Explore post-quantum algorithms for secure key exchange.  
- Adapt EKE for a post-quantum scenario, maintaining authenticity and confidentiality properties.

## Initial Structure

- `src/` – Project source code.  
- `report/` – Documentation and progress reports.  

## Dependencies

This project uses **PQClean**, an open-source library of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, for implementing the Kyber key exchange.  
Repository: [https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean)

## Status

Project in early stages.
